# Changelog
 
Nekos API does not follow a strict semantic versioning. Although there are many similarities, we:

- Do not upgrade the major version on every breaking change
- Add an `alpha.x` tag where `x` is the release candidate number (E.g. `v2.0.0-alpha.1` would be the first release candidate of the alpha version for `v2.0.0`)
