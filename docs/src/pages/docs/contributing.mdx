# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to the project. There are many ways you can help us make the API better.

## Code contributions

We're always looking for open-source contributors to help us expand the API. We have lots of things that need to be done/improved so if you know how to write code, create a ticket in our Discord server!

## Suggestions

Any ideas on how to improve the API? We'd be glad to here from you! Join our Discord server and head to the `#suggestions` channel. We'll discuss it with the other team members.

## Donations

The API is and will be free forever. However, we are currently having problems to pay for the servers. If you really like the API and want to contribute to it, you can make a donation on our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nekidev) page or buy us a coffee at [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/nekidev) or at [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/nekidev). All donations are welcome :)
