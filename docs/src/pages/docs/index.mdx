# Introduction

Welcome to the Nekos API documentation! Here you can find documentation, guides, and references for the API. Although it may not seem easy at first, we will guide you through the whole API so that you become a pro at it. This guide was written aiming to beginners, so you dont't need to be an expert to use and understand it.

The API is completely open-source. You can find everything in the Nekos API GitHub repository, including this docs, the website, the API, and everything else.

If you are looking for `v1.6.0` docs, you can find them at [v1.nekosapi.com](https://v1.nekosapi.com). You'll be able to access that version until we cannot host it anymore. If this is your first time using the API, then we recommend starting with this version, since it is more complete and is actively mantained. Also, `v1.6.0` has great disadvantages, like link expiry, lower rate limits, fewer images and features, etc.

## Copyright and Licenses

The API is 100% open-source. Everything can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nekos-API/Nekos-API). The whole project is distributed under the MIT license, which basically allows _commercial use_, _modification_, _distribution_ and _private use_ while requiring you to distribute a copy of the license with your version of the code (this is not legal advice). The official license file can be found [here](https://github.com/Nekos-API/Nekos-API/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Terms of Use

We do not have any legal document we can provide you with. You can find our guidelines [here](/docs/terms-of-use).

## Crediting

We do not require you to give us credit for anything when using the API. However, if your project uses the API it would be nice if you linked to our website in your project's description or specified somewhere that your project was made possible because of Nekos API. You can find different versions of our logo [here](/docs/branding).
