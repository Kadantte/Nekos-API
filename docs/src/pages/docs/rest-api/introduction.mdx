# Introduction

This page will help you understand how to use the Rest API. We highly recommend reading this before starting to use the API.

## Specification

To keep things clean and nice, we've decided to follow the JSON:API specification for `v2.x.x` versions and newer. We'll explain the basics here, but to understand better the whole specification we recommend reading the specification in the [official website](https://jsonapi.org/).

### What is JSON:API?

JSON:API is a specification to build APIs following a certain structure.

### But why JSON:API?

JSON:API removes a lot of work when developing the API and helps keeping thing consistent. It also brings a lot of new features to the API that makes implementation easier, (e.g. included resources).

From the JSON:API docs:

> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling and best practices. Clients built around JSON:API are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

### Headers

By default, all API endpoints will require the following header:

```http filename="GET /v2/:endpoint"
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

When sending a request body, you are also required to add a `Content-Type` header with the same value:

```http filename="PATCH /v2/users/@me"
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
```

There are some exceptions to this rule, like when uploading an image to the API, where a `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` header is used. These specific cases do not follow the JSON:API specification since the spec does not cover file uploads at all.

### Resource objects

Resource objects are used in both request and response bodies. It is a very extense topic to cover here, but you can read everything about it [here](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level).

### Errors

An error response will usually look like this:

```json filename="PATCH /v2/users/@me"
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided.",
            "status": "403",
            "source": {
                "pointer": "/data"
            },
            "code": "not_authenticated"
        }
    ]
}
```

Error responses return a top-level `errors` array containing all errors that appeared during the request. In this case, we can see that the request required authorization, but it was not provided.

The `detail` attribute describes the error in a human-readable way.

The `status` attrbute contains the status code for the response. This will always be a string, although the status codes will always be numbers.

The `source` object tells you where the error occurred. For example, if the source pointer is `/data/attributes/name`, it means that the error is located in the `name` attribute of the data sent in the request body.

The `code` attribute is an application-specific error code. You can send us this code if you need help handling an error.

### Pagination

The API supports pagination in all endpoints that return lists. The API only supports limit-offset pagination currently, although we may add support for more pagination methods in the future.

Pagination can be made specifying the following 2 parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                              | Type    | Default | Maximum   | Required |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| `page[limit]`  | The maximum amount of objects to return in the response. | Integer | 25      | 50        | No       |
| `page[offset]` | The amount of objects to skip in the response.           | Integer | 0       | Unlimited | No       |

#### Paginated responses

A paginated response usually looks like this:

```json filename="GET /v2/images?page[limit]=5&page[offset]=0"
{
    "links": {
        "first": "http://api.nekosapi.com/v2/images?page%5Blimit%5D=5",
        "last": "http://api.nekosapi.com/v2/images?page%5Blimit%5D=5",
        "next": null,
        "prev": null
    },

                    }
                }
            },
            "links": {
                "self": "http://api.nekosapi.com/v2/images/001a0c73-b9c6-498b-8b81-69fc3e527185"
            }
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "count": 1,
            "limit": 5,
            "offset": 0
        }
    }
}
```

There are 2 objects that give information about pagination in the response. The `links` object has the `first` and `last` attributes that specify the first and last page for that limit respectively and the `prev` and `next` attributes that specify the next and previous page (which in this case are null, but they will be urls like `first` and `last` when you make the request).

### Sorting

All endpoints that support pagination also support sorting. To sort the results in a response, you need to specify the `sort` query parameter containing a list of the fields to sort. For example, `sort=createdAt,title` will sort results by their creation date, and sort images with the same creation date by their title.

Let's see it in an example. Supppose that we have the following 3 objects:

1. `{ title: "Wonderful title", votes: 2 }`
2. `{ title: "Amazing title", votes: 2 }`
3. `{ title: "Great title", votes: 4 }`

They, in their current order, do not follow any special sorting rule. Now, if we sorted these objects using the `sort` query parameter with `votes,title`, then the objects would be sorted like this:

1. `{ title: "Amazing title", votes: 2 }`
2. `{ title: "Wonderful title", votes: 2 }`
3. `{ title: "Great title", votes: 4 }`

As you can see, the two objects with the lowest `votes` value have been moved to the top of the list, while the object with more votes has been sent to the bottom. Since there are 2 objects with 2 votes, these were sorted using the second parameter, the `title` property. We end up having 1) **2** votes, title with **A**, 2) **2** votes, staring with **W**, and 3) **4** votes, starting with **G**. The last object has not been sorted by title because there was no need to do so.

**Now, what if I want to sort these same objects, but using an inversed parameter (e.g. higher votes at the top)?** That's easy. Just prepend a `-` (minus) to the parameter you want to invert. For example, if those objects were sorted using `-votes,title`, the result would be:

1. `{ title: "Great title", votes: 4 }`
2. `{ title: "Amazing title", votes: 2 }`
3. `{ title: "Wonderful title", votes: 2 }`

And if you used `-votes,-title` the result would be:

1. `{ title: "Great title", votes: 4 }`
2. `{ title: "Wonderful title", votes: 2 }`
3. `{ title: "Amazing title", votes: 2 }`

You can specify as many sorting parameters as you like, so `votes` is correct and also `votes,-title,viewers` (if the objects had a `viewers` property).

### Filtering

You may sometimes want to filter the objects returned in a response. For example, if you'd like to get images created before certain date, or with a certain size, or even both. You can filter responses using the `filter[field.lookup?]` query parameters. Don't worry, they are all specified in each endpoint documentation.

**Ok, but... What does that mean?** Filter query parameters are (kind of) customizable. In a normal API, you would filter using something like `name=some+name`, but that's not the case here. Why? Because that kind of filtering limits applications a lot. What if I want to filter images to get only those that are higher than x pixels? What if I instead want to get users whose names match a RegEx? That would not be possible in a normal API, but as Nekos API is not a normal API, we support all those kind of features.

Let me give you an example. Imagine that you want to filter images that are higher than 1920 px and wider than 1080 px? Easy, you just add `?filter[height.gte]=1920&filter[width.gte]=1080` to the request's endpoint and you're ready to go. Let's analyze those query parameters. The first one, `filter[height.gte]`, has the two filter components, `field` and `lookup`, being `height` the field and `gte` the lookup. In this case, you are filtering the `height` image's attribute, returning only the ones greater than or equal to (`gte` means **G**reater **T**han or **E**qual) the value specified. We're also doing that with the `width` attribute, getting only those greater than or equal to the value specified.

You can use any of the multiple possible values for the `lookup` component of a filtering query parameter, or you can just omit it. Some of the most common ones that you will see are:

| Name         | Description                                                                     | Type                             | Example                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `exact`      | Matches the exact value                                                         | Any                              | `filter[lastName.exact]=Hatsune`        |
| `iexact`     | Matches the exact value, case insensitive                                       | String                           | `filter[lastName.iexact]=hAtSuNe`       |
| `contains`   | Matches attributes containing that exact value                                  | String                           | `filter[lastName.contains]=atsu`        |
| `icontains`  | Matches attributes containing the value, case insensitive                       | String                           | `filter[lastName.icontains]=atsu`       |
| `in`         | Matches attributes in a list                                                    | List delimited by a `,`          | `filter[lastName.in]=Hatsune,Shinomiya` |
| `gt`         | Matches greater than a value                                                    | Number                           | `filter[height.gt]=1000`                |
| `lt`         | Matches lower than a value                                                      | Number                           | `filter[height.lt]=1000`                |
| `gte`        | Matches greater than or equal to a value                                        | Number                           | `filter[height.gte]=1000`               |
| `lte`        | Matches lower than or equal to a value                                          | Number                           | `filter[height.lte]=1000`               |
| `startswith` | Matches attributes starting with a value                                        | String                           | `filter[name.startswith]=Hatsu`         |
| `endswith`   | Matches attributes ending with a value                                          | String                           | `filter[name.endswith]=Hatsu`           |
| `regex`      | Matches attributes that match a PostgreSQL regular expression                   | String                           | `filter[name.regex]=^([a-z]+)$`         |
| `iregex`     | Matches attributes that match a PostgreSQL regular expression, case insensitive | String                           | `filter[name.iregex]=^([a-z]+)$`        |
| `day`        | Matches date type attributes with a specific day number                         | Number between `1` and `31`      | `filter[createdAt.day]=15`              |
| `month`      | Matches date type attributes with a specific month                              | Number between `1` and `12`      | `filter[createdAt.month]=3`             |
| `year`       | Matches date type attributes with a specific year                               | Number matching `(1\|2)[0-9]{3}` | `filter[createdAt.year]=2022`           |

There are more possible `lookup` values. You'll find an explanation about each in each parameter's description.

### Included resources

In almost every endpoint you can also specify the `include` query parameter. This is very useful when you need more than one resource, since it considerably reduces the amount of requests.

Included resources are (as the name says) resources that are included in the same response. For example, if you need to get an image with it's uploader, you can make a request with the `include` parameter set to `uploader`.

```json filename="GET /v2/images/001a0c73-b9c6-498b-8b81-69fc3e527185?include=uploader"
{
    "data": {

As you may see, in this response there is a new top-level array, `included`, which contains an object of the `user` type. If you compare the IDs between the image's uploader and the `user` resource object returned inside the `included` array you'll notice that the IDs are the same. That means that you now have the image's data AND the uploader's data all in a single request. This way, you have completely removed a request and therefore optimized your code.

This may not seem that amazing at first, but imagine if you need an image and all it's category data (not only their IDs). In an image with 5 categories, you are avoiding making 5 extra requests for each category!

**But what if I need the image's categories AND the uploader?** It's easy. Just set the `include` parameter to `uploader,categories` and that's it. You now have the image data, the image's categories data, and the uploader's data all in one request.

## Rate limits

The API has a rate limit of **3 requests per second**. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 response. You can use the `Retry-After` and the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to determine how long to wait before retrying.

We have increased the amount of requests per second to allow everyone to build faster projects without worrying too much about rate limits. Try to avoid getting ratelimited as we may reduce the amount of allowed requests in the future if we detect that this permissive limit is causing API slowdown.

## Authentication

This version of the API uses OAuth2 to authorize users and get access/refresh tokens. You can read detailed instructions on how to authorize users in the [Authorization](/docs/rest-api/authorization) page.
