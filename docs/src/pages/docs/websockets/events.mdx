# Events

Events allow you to get notified when a certain event occurs in the API, such as an image creation, update, or deletion.

```

```

## Subscribe/Unsubscribe from an Event [#subscribe-or-unsubscribe-from-an-event]

To subscribe or unsubscribe from an event, send a JSON message following this schema:

```json filename="Message schema"
{
    "event": String,    // [Required] The code of the event
    "subscribe": true,  // [Required] `true` to subscribe, `false` to unsubscribe
    "data": {           // [Optional] Allows to subscribe to events related to a specific resource
        "type": String, // [Required] The resource type (the one returned in Rest API's responses) of the resource to which the events you are subscribing to
        "id": String    // [Required] The resource ID of the resource to which the events you are subscribing to
    }
}
```

You can subscribe to multiple events sending a subscription event multiple times, one for each event to which you are subscribing to.

<Callout type="info">
    If you have subscibed to two events that send the same notification, you will only receive the notification once.
    
    E.g. you subscribed to all image updates and to updates of an image with ID `123`. If that image gets updated, you'll only get one notification message although two events are sending you the same notification.
</Callout>
