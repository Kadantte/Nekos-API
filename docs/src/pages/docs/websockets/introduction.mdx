# WebSockets

This page will help you understand how websockets work and how you can use Nekos API's WebSocket API.

## What are WebSockets

WebSocket is a computer communication protocol that allows bidirectional communication between the client and the server. The difference between WebSocket connections and HTTP requests is that while in HTTP requests the client connects, makes a request, the server responds, and the connection is closed, WebSocket connections allow the client and the server to send messages at any time without closing the connection. For example:

### HTTP connection

> Connection established
>
> (Client)<br/>
> GET /v2/images/random<br/>
> Host: api.nekosapi.com<br/>
> Accept: application/vnd.api+json
>
> (Server)<br/>
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
>
> Connection closed

In this case, the client connected, made a request to which the server responded with an image, and the connection was closed. WebSocket connections are a bit different.

### WebSocket connection

> Connection established
>
> (Client)<br/>
> GET /ws/events HTTP/1.1<br/>
> Host: api.nekosapi.com<br/>
> Upgrade: websocket<br/>
> Connection: Upgrade<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
>
> (Server)
> HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols<br/>
> Upgrade: websocket<br/>
> Connection: Upgrade<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Some message
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Another message
>
> (Server)<br/>
> A random notification
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Some random message
>
> (Server)<br/>
> Even another random notification
>
> Connection closed

*Note: The message formatting has been omitted for readability purposes.*

As you may see, in this case the server does not depend on the client to send a message at any time and viceversa. This way you can get, e.g., realtime notifications, events, messages, and anything instantly.

## Why WebSockets

Why does the API have 2 different protocols? Wouldn't it be easier for everyone to have just one protocol?

The API is not intended to be beginner-friendly nor something "easy to use". The API tries to be as complete as possible, and we've reached a point where HTTP is no longer a good option. WebSockets are currently (kind of) a mirror for HTTP WebHooks. This is because WebHooks are only an option if you have a server or an IP exposed to the internet. This means that anything that is not a web server is left apart of realtime notifications.

WebSockets bring a solution to this problem. You no longer need to open ports in your machine, set up any port forwarding, or buy/pay for a server. You can just connect to the API and subscribe to what you need to. This way mobile apps, desktop apps, and pretty much anything that has a WebSocket library can receive instant notifications from the API. That's why Nekos API's WebSocket API was created.
