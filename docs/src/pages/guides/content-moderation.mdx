# The Ultimate Guide to Content Moderation

This guide specifies how content (images) should be managed in Nekos API. It covers most topics, but if you have any doubts about the meaning of something, or would like something explained in detail, just DM [Neki#1587](https://discord.com/users/777338793803513886).

## Image uploading

When uploading an image, you should check the following:

1. The image is not in an extremely low quality. It should not pixelate when covering the whole screen (either width or height).
2. The image is not a meme. This kind of content is not allowed in the API since the main purpose of the API is serving anime illustrations alone.
3. The image is not a modified version of the original. No cropping, watermark, rotation, filter, or any kind of modification is allowed to the original images.
4. The image hasn't got watermarks saying something like *Do not repost*, *Comission*, *Copyright x artist*, *Reproducing is prohibited*, etc. *Sample* watermarks are not allowed. Watermarks are only acceptable when they credit the artist (copyright watermarks are not allowed to prevent legal problems).
5. The image must not have been taken from an official source. Official art is not currently allowed in the API. Images drawn by the original artist which are not official content are allowed, but they should be omitted if possible.
6. No manga pages or short stories allowed. The API is oriented to fanarts and therefore this is not allowed.
7. Preferably no sketches or incomplete illustrations. This can vary depending of the quality of the sketch. If you consider that a sketch is very good and should be included in the API, you can 

## Quality standard

The API follows a strict quality standard to keep the API's quality consistent (and high, very high). There are certain basic requisites that images should follow to apply. Mainly, these are:

1. High resolution images. Images should be at least HD.
2. Good illustration. This is very subjective to the moderator's liking, but there are some examples below to help you understand this standard.

Since it's difficult to write these standards into text, you can see the following examples to see what's allowed and what's not.

    return (
        <div className="w-full flex flex-col gap-2" style={{
            gridColumn: `span ${colSpan} / span ${colSpan}`
        }}>
            <img src={url} className="object-cover w-full" style={{
                aspectRatio: colSpan == 1 ? "2/3" : "144/100"
            }} />
            <div className="flex flex-row gap-2">

If you have any doubts regarding any image's quality and wether it should be accepted or not, yu can send a message to the staff channel and we'll discuss it together.

## Age rating

There are 5 different age ratings: `sfw`, `questionable`, `suggestive`, `borderline`, and `explicit`. Each of them defines how much an image is intended to be erotic. It is called age rating, but in fact, `sfw` is for all ages, `questionable` is for +13, `suggestive` is for +16, and `borderline` and `explicit` should not be seen by people younger than 18 years old.

### SFW

SFW means **S**afe **F**or **W**ork, which basically means that if your grandma sees the image, she would be completely fine with it. Same at work, though you shouldn't be looking at anime images at work.

#### Examples

These are some real life examples of what is considered SFW content:

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8 mt-8 relative">
    <ImageExample
        allowed={true}
        colSpan={2}
        title="Not even slightly erotic"
        description={"Your grandma would be fine if she saw this. She'd even say \"Oh, how cute! I also had a dog when I was young.\""}
        url="https://cdn.nekosapi.com/uploads/images/B3OGDH4FHFC4LPNCR2YBZIBA4E.webp" />

    <ImageExample
        allowed={true}
        title="No doubts this is SFW"
        description={"Be honest, you'r grandma likes these kind of art. She'd probably say something like \"The beach! I loved going on holidays there with my family when I was young\". She may even tell you an anecdote."}
