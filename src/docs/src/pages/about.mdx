# About Nekos API

Nekos API is a free rest API for anime images and gifs. We try to provide the best service possible and we are always open to suggestions. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/PgQnuM3YnM).

## Why Nekos API?

There are several reasons why you should use Nekos API:

-   **100% free**: No hidden costs.
-   **Fast by default**: We use a CDN to deliver images and gifs.
-   **Seamless integration**: We provide officially supported API wrappers that will help you integrate the API in your project in seconds.
-   **Advanced features**: Getting many resources in a single request, advanced filters and a clean specification make the API one of the most advanced anime images APIs out there.
-   **Thousands of images**: We have thousands of images (more than 10,000) and we are adding more every day.
-   **Descriptive metadata**: We provide metadata for every image and gif, including color palettes, characters, categories, artists, sources, and even more.
-   **Official wrappers**: We provide free open-source API wrappers to speed up the implementation.

## Why not Nekos API?

There are only two reasons why you wouldn't want to use Nekos API:

-   **It is not beginner friendly**: Although we try to make the API documentation easy to understand, the API is not easy to implement if you are a beginner.
-   **It is not what you're looking for**: Many times, this is just not what you need for your projects.

## Can I use Nekos API for commercial projects?

Yes, you can use Nekos API for commercial projects. We don't have any restrictions from us on that. However, <u>**_we are NOT the copyright holders of the images provided_**</u> and therefore we cannot license them to you. We try to provide the author of every image, but we can't guarantee that we have the correct information. If you want to use an image for commercial purposes, you should contact the author of the image.
