# Getting Started

Time to get started! Nekos API is mainly focused on it's RESTful part, but it also supports WebSocket events and a few embeds. Despite it's name, Nekos API does not only serve catgirl images (this was changed from version 1.0.0 onwards) but actually almost any kind of anime-styled artwork.

We DO serve AI """art""", though we're working on a separate AI to allow you to remove these images from the API responses in general. We'll probably end up removing them from the API in the future.

## For Beginners

If you're a beginner to programming, you MUST know how to do the following things in the programming language of your choice to use Nekos API:

- How to make HTTP requests
- How to read and parse JSON responses

Know that Nekos API is not what you'd call "for beginners" since it has a lot of complex stuff to learn, but it's also a fun way to learn new stuff. While it may be frustrating at times, it's definetly not impossible. 

If you want something easier to use (and less feature-packed), you probably want to check out [Nekos API V1.6.0](https://v1.nekosapi.com/). There are also many other anime APIs that you may want to check out as well, such as [OtakuGIFs](https://otakugifs.xyz/) or [Nekogirl API](https://api.nekogirl.net/). They're much easier to use, but less feature-packed in general.

Though you probably find it tedious (everyone does), it's better if you read all the docs for what you're trying to do before trying to use it. You'll probably notice that what you're doing could be better or learn about a feature you didn't know about.

## For Advanced Users

Nekos API follows the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/) where possible (pretty much everywhere). Despite nothing is taken as "obvious" in the API documentation, you may want to check it out if you wish to have a better understanding on how the API works in general.

## Libraries

There are several community-made API wrappers that you may want to check out. They're all documented [here](/docs/libraries). We're currently working to migrate them from V1 to V2.
