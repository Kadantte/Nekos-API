# Getting Started

Time to get started! Nekos API is mainly focused on it's RESTful part, but it also supports WebSocket events and a few embeds. Despite it's name, Nekos API does not only serve catgirl images (this was changed from version 1.0.0 onwards) but actually almost any kind of anime-styled artwork.

We DO serve AI art, though we're working on a separate AI to allow you to remove these images from the API responses in general. We'll probably end up removing them from the API in the future.

## For Beginners

If you're a beginner to programming, you MUST know how to do the following things in the programming language of your choice to use Nekos API:

- How to make HTTP requests
- How to read and parse JSON responses

Nekos API is made as simple as possible, so you shoulnd't encounter any issues using it. If you have any doubts, you can ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PgQnuM3YnM)!

## Libraries

There are several community-made API wrappers that you may want to check out. They're all documented [here](/docs/libraries). We're currently working to migrate them from V1 to V3.

## Support

Having trouble with the API? Discovered a super-rare error and you cannot figure out how to sort it? Wanna chat and have a good time? Then our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PgQnuM3YnM) is for you!
