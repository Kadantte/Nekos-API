# Libraries

These libraries are officialy supported wrappers. They are intended to make easier the task of implementing the API in your project.

<Callout type='warning'>
    These libraries were developed for `v1.x.x` versions and are now being rewritten for `v3.0.0`. The `v1.6.0` documentation can be found at [v1.nekosapi.com](https://v1.nekosapi.com/docs/libraries).
