# WebSockets API

This page will help you understand how websockets work and how you can use Nekos API's WebSocket API.

## What are WebSockets

WebSocket is a computer communication protocol that allows bidirectional communication between the client and the server. The difference between WebSocket connections and HTTP requests is that while in HTTP requests the client connects, makes a request, the server responds, and the connection is closed, WebSocket connections allow the client and the server to send messages at any time without closing the connection. For example:

### HTTP connection

> Connection established
>
> (Client)<br/>
> GET /v2/images/random<br/>
> Host: api.nekosapi.com<br/>
> Accept: application/vnd.api+json
>
> (Server)<br/>
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br/>
> Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
>
> Connection closed

In this case, the client connected, made a request to which the server responded with an image, and the connection was closed. WebSocket connections are a bit different.

### WebSocket connection

> Connection established
>
> (Client)<br/>
> GET /ws/events HTTP/1.1<br/>
> Host: api.nekosapi.com<br/>
> Upgrade: websocket<br/>
> Connection: Upgrade<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
>
> (Server)
> HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols<br/>
> Upgrade: websocket<br/>
> Connection: Upgrade<br/>
> Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Some message
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Another message
>
> (Server)<br/>
> A random notification
>
> (Client)<br/>
> Some random message
>
> (Server)<br/>
> Even another random notification
>
> Connection closed

*Note: The message formatting has been omitted for readability purposes.*

As you may see, in this case the server does not depend on the client to send a message at any time and viceversa. This way you can get, e.g., realtime notifications, events, messages, and anything instantly.

## Why WebSockets

Mainly, the WebSockets API was added to send realtime notifications and events to both the client and the server. This way you can get realtime notifications, events, messages, and anything instantly. The API also supports webhooks, but they're still a work in progress and not yet available.
